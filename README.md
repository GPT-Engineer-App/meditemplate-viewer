# meditemplate-viewer

XRreport viewer:

This is likely a web-based interface designed for viewing, creating, or managing radiological report templates.
The top bar indicates the application's name and has an icon that suggests functionality related to reports or documents.
Templates Section:

Categorized into at least three groups: COVID-19, Neuroradiology, and Oncology, suggesting a focus on medical reporting.
Allows users to add new templates, signifying customizable reporting options.
Main Panel (Templates List):

Templates are shown as individual cards, indicating a library or repository of templates.
Each card has:
A title: Indicates the purpose or content of the template (e.g., "Rectum tumor primer staging", "COVID-19 CT Structured Report").
A status tag: Shows whether the template is a 'draft' or 'ready', denoting the stage of completeness.
Creation information: Shows the anonymity and time since creation, indicating privacy options and time-tracking.
Icons:
Pencil icon: Likely an edit function.
Eye icon: Presumably a view or preview function.
Functionality (inferred from the UI elements):

Add new template:
A central button indicates the ability to create new reporting templates.
Template management:
The cards allow for editing, viewing, and possibly deleting (not visible, but common in such interfaces).
Search and filter:
The left sidebar categories suggest a filter mechanism to narrow down templates by medical specialization.
User interaction:
The "Sign in" button in the top right corner indicates user account management features.
The varying time stamps (e.g., '8 months ago', '2 years ago') suggest a timeline of user activity and template updates.
The anonymous creation indicates a focus on user privacy or shared use without attributing to a specific individual.
Design considerations:

The design is clean and minimalistic, likely intended to ensure ease of use and not overwhelm users with information.
The use of dark mode suggests an awareness of user comfort, especially in low-light environments, which is common in radiology departments.
Developmental Insights:

This interface would be part of a larger system designed for medical professionals to streamline the reporting process.
It's built to support multiple users and anonymized interactions, hinting at collaborative environments with privacy needs.
The structure implies a database backend for storing and retrieving template data, user activity logs, and possibly version control for the templates.
